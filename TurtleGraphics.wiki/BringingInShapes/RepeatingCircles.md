# Turtle Graphics with Python

## The Olympic Rings

![Rings](./BringingInShapes/Rings.png)

Given that:

 1. The rings are positioned at: (-180, 0), (0,0), (180,0),(-90,-90) and (90,-90). 
 2. Their colors are blue, black, red, yellow and lime.
 3. The radius of each ring is 80.

Can you use `penup() setpos() pendown() pencolor() and circle()` to draw them on the screen?
