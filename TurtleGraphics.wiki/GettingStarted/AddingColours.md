## Adding colours

1. You haven't got to stick with a black line on a white background. Look at the list of named colours on this web page:  

 [Colours web page](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23237.small-basic-getting-started-guide-appendix-b-colors.aspx)

 *from now we have to use the American spelling for colours which is colors (not my fault)*

2. Make a note of some of your favourite colors which we can use to draw the line and paint the background of our window

3. Use this code to change the the background color

 `window.bgcolor("lime")`  

> TIP - this function needs to be called 'after' the screen has been created but 'before' elsa does any drawing on the background 


4. Use this code to change the color of the pen elsa is using

  `elsa.pencolor("indigo")`

5. You can also increase the size the pen  elsa is using

  `elsa.pensize(5)`

6. Experiment with using different colors for the pen and background.
